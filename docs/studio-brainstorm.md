# Game Studio Brainstorming Template

## Studio Name Ideas
- **Primary Ideas:**
  - Lariet Games
  - Equinox
  - Acheron Digital
- **Alternative Ideas:**
  - Hallowfall
  - Radient Studios
  - Elysian Voyage

- **Chosen Name**: Acheron Digital
- **About the name**: Styx felt too common, so I googled the other rivers found in the Underworld. Acheron sounded the nicest. The character is also pretty in honkai, yes, I am aware. I just want the ferryman imagery. If I didn't use Acheron I would have used Lethe just because the concept is cool.
- **Social Medias with name available**: AcheronDigital
- **Possible domain names available**: AcheronDigital.com

## Unique Selling Point (USP)
*What will make your games stand out from others, particularly in the indie/board game space?*

> I personally am not a huge fan of board or card games. I enjoy RPGs or visual novel games, so to fit within the project for this course I'm thinking I could still achieve a story either explicitly told or hidden in card descriptions.
> The story telling will focus on a multiverse where all these character cards coexist in the same universe. Each card will tell the story of a different character and it's up to the player to piece together how all of the events come together. This way, we'll be able to leave hints regarding the timeline and have cameos of characters from other games that hint towards their role in the overarching story. The card game itself can be simple to allow for players to focus on card collection and hidden story.

## Additional Notes
*Include any other ideas, inspirations, or thoughts related to your studio or project.*
I'm mostly inspired by the game Inscryption and the way Genshin communicates story through books found and artifact & weapon descriptions. Also the genshin TCG. My story is entierly my own, but how to implement it into a card game comes entierly from these two.

> [Free space for brainstorming!]
> Not sure how well I'll be able to draw my TCG cards since I strictly do not color and especially do not draw digitally. I'll manage tho.
