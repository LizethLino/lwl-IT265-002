# IT265 Design Treatment Checkpoint

---

## Title
<!-- 
Enter the name of your game concept. 
Make it concise yet engaging, reflecting the game's essence. 
-->
System Failure
---

## Concept Statement
<!-- 
Provide a one-sentence summary that captures the core idea of your game. 
This should convey what makes your game unique in a compelling way. 
-->
A race to find the key to salvation before you all lose yourselves to the void; friend becomes foe in the blink of an eye during the end of the world.
---

## Genre and Style

### Genre
<!-- 
Specify the game's genre (e.g., action, adventure, strategy, puzzle). 
Mention any sub-genres if applicable. 
-->
Strategy RPG board game
---

### Style
<!-- 
Describe the tone, visual approach, and gameplay feel. 
Examples: "A dark, gothic horror with hand-drawn 2D animation" or 
"A lighthearted, comedic party game with vibrant colors and exaggerated physics." 
-->
A fast-paced, strategy game with 2D drawing for character cards and unique 3D location tiles.
Tiles are limited to 2D where they are differentiated by their color.
---

## Target Audience

### Demographics
<!-- 
Identify the target age group, interests, and gamer profile. 
Mention if your game appeals to casual or hardcore players. 
-->
Targetted towards people 12 and up who are interested in roleplay elements, strategy, and story. It would likely not be appealing to casual gamers since it requires keeping track of your own hp. In a digital concept however this would be done for you so it may be more accessible to casual players.
---

### Accessibility
<!-- 
Describe how the game will accommodate different skill levels. 
Will there be difficulty modes, tutorials, assistive options, etc.? 
-->
Skill levels can be accomodated through a tutorial level that walks you through the game before playing against actual players. Modes of difficulty is unlikely to make the game any easier since the point is for it to be a slightly challenging strategy game.

Mode of difficulty to be considered is increasing the chances of recieving the gate key. The less likely it is to get the harder the game is since you have to survive longer.
---

### Inclusivity Strategies
<!-- 
Explain how the game promotes inclusivity. 
Consider gender representation, cultural diversity, and accessibility features for disabled players. 
-->
Try to make each tile unique by adding notches or unique symbols. For example, instead of the one-use tiles all being squares with a different symbol, they should all have an imprinted symbol that can be felt by a blind player to identify them. Perhaps an accompanying app to tell you what certain cards are.
The character cards are of varying races, sexualities, and circumstances although it might not be immediately apparent. Some that come to mind are nonbinary characters, lesbian characters, divorced characters, etc.

We can eventually update the tile cards to have displays of the area they represent (kingdom, ruins, etc)

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics
<!-- 
List and describe the core gameplay mechanics players will engage with. 
Explain how they contribute to the game's challenge and fun. 
-->
Character Deck: On your team, you will have three characters that you pull from the shuffled character deck. The enemies you encounter in the game are characters that have fallen to corruption. They are people who could have very well been on your team. As you traverse the expanding area, you may encounter enemies. Pull from the character deck to see who it is.

Team leader: When you begin the game, pull three cards from the character deck. Choose your team captain from the three cards. They will take damage from the opposing team. If your team leader is eliminated you can choose who to make the new team leader.

Character Special Ability: Every character has a special ability. This is something unique to them that can be used to put your team at an advantage over others. Has limited uses. Special abilities will specify if you can use them during traversal, combat, or both.

Combat: Place the team leader at the front with the two other characters behind them. During your turn you can use one special ability before performing an action (attack or use item). You may also choose to retreat from a battle.

Character type: TANK, SUPPORT, DAMAGE. TANK has max DEF at 2. SUPPORT has max SPD at 3. DAMAGE has max ATK at 3. 

Character Stats: HP always starts at 20. ATK ranges from 1-3. DEF ranges from 0-2. SPD ranges from 1-3. Based on SPD, add up SPD of all characters on your team and compare against the enemy's total SPD, whoever has the most goes first. Based on ATK, roll matching number of dice and attack the team leader of the opposing team. Based on DEF, remove the highest dice rolls with the remaining dice being your damage. 

Static locations: Starting zone cannot be reentered once it is left. This is where you start the game. The ending location is the portal out blocked by a locked gate which must be opened using a key.

Dynamic location tiles: Location tiles are color coded. If your team has a character with a matching color, their SPD increases by 1. Consider it home turf advantage. The characters are all from different dimensions, the color of the location tiles tells you what dimension it is. If you move onto a place where a tile has not been placed, pull a new tile and put it where you are.

Corruption: A meter that starts at 0 for all characters. Ranges from 0-3. Every time your corruption increases, their HP goes up by 5. Once corruption reaches 3, the character turns on you and you must fight them. 

Event cards: From the moment you leave the starting area, pull an event card every other turn. Cards may be as simple as finding an item (potion, weapon, shield, key, movement double, corruption reduction) or a command with a consequence if it isn't performed. Consequence event cards tell you to do something and if you don't do it, raise corruption level of one of your characters by 1. You choose which one takes on the corruption. Certain consequence event cards are significantly worse and will prompt you to raise a character's corruption by 2 (capped at 3) if ignored. There is also a game over card labeled WRATH that forcibly corrupts all of your characters and eliminates you from the game which cannot be ignored. 

Abandonment: If a character is getting too close to their corruption threshold, you can choose to abandon them. Place their character card on the top of the character card deck. Whoever encounters an enemy next will be facing your old teammate.

### Goals and Challenges
<!-- 
Detail what players aim to achieve and the obstacles they must overcome. 
Explain how these challenges drive player engagement. 
-->
Your goal is to make it through the portal with at least one of your characters alive. Within the game, there will be multiple ways to get to the portal. Killing off other teams will eliminate competition and being the last team standing gives you the automatic win. A gate blocks the portal so finding the key to the gate is also a way to win. You could also attempt to break through the gate by force which takes time or high tier weapons. There is also the method of finding a backdoor to the portal. No matter what method you choose whoever makes it to the portal first is the winner. Challenges come in the form of event cards. These events cards will command you to do something that puts you at a disadvantage (Event Card: Wrath, kill off one of the teammates of your choice and add them into the character pile to return as an enemy. Lose the items that character is holding.) Choosing to ignore these event cards will accumulate corruption on your team leader. Once your team leader reaches max corruption they will turn on you and attack you with the weapons you gave to them. It is important to take into consideration when to abandon a teammate based on your position. Sometimes a corrupted teammate may be best to keep around because you need their abilities to be stronger. Even when you choose to abandon them is important if you notice an enemy team is likely to pull an event card next, they will be forced to deal with your corrupted teammate.

### Progression
<!-- 
Describe how the gameplay evolves over time. 
Are there new abilities, unlockable levels, skill trees, or difficulty scaling? 
-->
As time progresses in the game, you accumulate more items and may have less uses for your special abilities, so tension may build in the game. The more time passes, the harder the game will get since you're limited to three characters.

### Game Rules
<!-- 
Outline the core rules governing the gameplay experience. 
Ensure they are clear, structured, and intuitive. 
-->
On game begin, pick three cards from the character deck and select the one with the highest DEF to be your team leader. This will be the character that takes the damage during combat.
Once both players have their three cards, place your piece in the starting location and begin your turn. You can decide who goes first. A traditional rock paper scissors will suffice.
On turn begin:
1. move to one of the tiles connected to the starting tile. (Imagine that the starting tile in the final demo will be a long strip on the left side of the grid. Player can choose to jump onto any of the tiles next to the starting strip). Same logic applies to all consecutive turns. You are able to go onto any tile that neighbors your current one.
2. Depending on the tile color, your characters may get a speed buff due to HomeTurfAdvantage. All this means is that if the character card and tile type are the same, increase character speed by 1. This is relevent during combat. When not on matching tile, speed remains the same.
3. If the tile you land on has an opposing player, combat is initiated (read combat portion). If all character cards are dead, you automatically lose. You may choose to retreat to avoid/escape combat and jump within a certain radius of your current tile.
4. Every two turns pull a card from the event deck. The event deck has three types of unique events. The find item event, the encounter enemy event, and the special consequence event. The special event consequence card will grant you some sort of disadvantage. But fear not! You have two options when pulling an event card. Either accept and bear the weight of the consequence, or ignore and increment the corruption value of one of your character cards.
  - When corruption for any character reaches 3, they are now an enemy and combat will begin. Your remaining cards will fight against the corrupted character. (Read combat portion)
  - Before corruption reaches 3, your characters will find themselves becoming stronger. For every increase in corruption, HP increases by 5 pts. But once they reach corruption level 3, this increase in strength will make them a deadly foe. (crrpt = 0 -> hp = 20, crrpt = 1 -> hp = 25, ...). In this situation you may choose to abandon your teammate. Put them on the top of the character card deck and set their CRRPT = 3. They will be the next encountered enemy for whoever player pulls the card.
  - As for find item and encounter enemy events, these two have no consequences and cannot be ignored. The items you find each serve some sort of purpose and depending on what they are they can be used during combat or on the field grid (combat -> sword, field -> movement x2, ...). Encounter an enemy will initiate combat with your character cards and the encountered enemy (Read combat portion).
4. As you traverse the tiles, for every item card you pull you have a chance of finding a key. Once you have the key, race to the gate (like starting strip but on the right side) and get to the gate to win. Only those with keys can open the gate.
  - An opposing player may choose to intercept you in this moment. They may choose to use their special ability if it helps them. Players have the different ways they can steal the win away from you in this moment. (Kill their whole team, special ability that steals items, movement x2 tile, etc)

Combat portion
1. When combat is initiated, the team leader is put in the front and they are the ones to take damage. (In the case of an encountered enemy, they are automatically the team leader).
2. Add up the speed of all of your characters and if the total speed of your team exceeds the speed of the opposing team, you go first. (This is where the speed buff comes into play).
3. A turn begins. One of your characters attack the opposing team lead. You can select any of your character cards. Damage is determined by a dice roll based on your attacking character's ATK. For every ATK point, roll a dice and add up for total damage. The opposing player's team lead uses the same logic to counter some of that damage using their DEF stat. (Say atk=3, rawDMG is 13. Opposing player def=2, counteredDMG is 7. totalDMG=rawDMG-counteredDMG.)
4. Before attacking, you can use an item or use your special ability. An item like the sword will raise your atk by 1 making you do more damage. A special ability may allow you to attack twice. You can only use 1 item and 1 special ability per turn. And stats cap at a certain point.

## Story and Setting

### Setting
<!-- 
Describe the game world, its rules, and any unique environmental elements. 
Provide enough detail to establish immersion. 
-->
The setting is a world where people of many lands (and even other dimensions) have come together to live as one striving for greater things. Generally nature and technology have united in a unique way to create a picture of cool colors and thriving wildlife. There are many species and civilizations each with rich and unique history seperate from eachother. The multiverse that this dimension lives in is one bound by the hands of fate. Defying your fate creates instability in a dimension and once too much instability has accumulated, a dimension will collapse into the abyss between worlds. It is for this reason that fate has bound people to their destinies. If people cannot defy a set path, then instability cannot accumulate and the people will live and die as they should. However this world, as far as it has come felt that the laws that fate so kindle bestowed onto them were shackles and chose to forcibly liberate themselves from their paths. Instability ran rampant and human hubris grew exponentially. Fate cared not for the arrogant mortals and allowed them to die by their own hands. But fate is kind, and so she allowed for one final back door to help any mortals that were strong or smart enough to make it out.

### Plot
<!-- 
Outline the central narrative arc. 
What is the player’s role in the story, and what major events drive the gameplay forward? 
-->
"Our world is bound by fate. Every action you have ever done or will one day do has already been determined. And yet, your world had the gall to liberate itself from universal laws. For your people's audacity, the world has been doomed to fall, but fear not! The last survivors will be allowed to escape with their lives. Be you good or bad, all are free to walk out on their own two feet. A game of survival where friends and foes my turn on one another, who will be the one to make it out alive with their sanity intact?"

The world is collapsing and any who come too close to the instability lose their minds to the corruption. A single portal remains open and it is your job to find you way to the portal with a method of opening the gate that seperates you from freedom. Dungeons have appeared in the farthest corners of the world that are home to weapons and tools. Traverse this ever growing dungeon filled with the shadows of your friends and family to find what you need. Outside of the dungeon you have some rooms that will provide you with other services but beware of the other teams that are trying for the same goal as you. If they see you as a threat, they may just choose to kill you or die trying.

### Characters
<!-- 
List key characters, their roles, and how they impact the story. 
Describe their motivations, personality traits, and influence on the player’s journey. 
-->
The characters in your team are people who were in the doomed world at the time of its collapse. This does not necessarily mean that this is their home world however. The game features different characters with unique stories and personalities. Your team will consist of three characters or less. Some examples of characters are,
- The Innovator
- The Oracle
- The King
- The Outlander
- The Derelict
- etc.

## Unique Selling Points (USP)
<!-- 
Identify what makes your game stand out from others in its genre. 
Highlight key features that differentiate it in the market. 
-->
The unique selling point of the game is the corruption system. Being able to keep characters and abandon them at a tactically opportune time makes my game unique from the others.

---

## Inspiration

### Sources
<!-- 
List books, movies, historical events, or games that influenced this project. 
-->
Games like Betrayal at House on the Hill and standard Gacha games like Genshin, Honkai, and Cookie Run Kingdom. I also used my own story which features the multiverse theory (probably from my Undertale phase). 
---

### Why It Matters
<!-- 
Explain how these inspirations shape the game’s mechanics, visuals, or themes. 
-->
The multiverse theory influences the concept of location tiles being color coded and giving certain characters higher speed. That way you know that certain characters are from post-apocalyptic worlds, cyberpunk cities, science motivated societies, etc.
Betrayal at House on the Hill influenced my idea on making the expanding map and having different characters with unique stats.
Giving characters special abilities and RNG to see who you get comes from Gacha games.
---

## Player Experience Goals
<!-- 
Describe the intended player emotions and reactions. 
Examples: excitement, curiosity, tension, relaxation, humor. 
-->
Players should be excited and tense since the special abilities make the gameplay unpredictable and fast paced.
---

## Technical Requirements

### Platform
<!-- 
Specify where the game will be played (e.g., PC, console, mobile, VR). 
Mention any cross-platform support if applicable. 
-->
Game will ve played on PC mostly because I'm most comfortable with PC games. Mobile might be limiting but feasible with zoom in/out features.

### Tools
<!-- 
List key engines, programming languages, or frameworks required for development. 
-->
Unity and C#

---

## Art and Sound Direction

### Visual Style
<!-- 
Describe the art direction, including color schemes, animation style, and UI elements. 
-->
Art direction should allow UI to be duller and monochrome colors so that the grid pops in comparison. The UI could be made to look sketchy to match my character designs.

### Sound Design
<!-- 
Explain the role of music, sound effects, and audio feedback in enhancing immersion. 
-->
Sound design should be tense and echoey. Imagine the backgroud music to bethe sort of thing you'd here in a dark cave. Attacking cards and clicking buttons should have unique sounds. Each character should have voice lines that play during their attacks and use of special ability. Field special abilities should have

---

## Monetization Strategy
<!-- 
Describe how the game will generate revenue. 
Examples: one-time purchase, freemium model, ads, DLC, cosmetics, subscriptions. 
-->
Likely it would have ads to generate revenue. The game may also be able to implement cards that you can only attain through purchase to add to your deck although that doesnt seem very fair.
---

## Treatment Details

### Gameplay Example
<!-- 
Write a step-by-step walkthrough of a core gameplay scenario. 
Explain what the player does, the challenges faced, and how the game responds. 
-->
The player begins the turn in the starting tile and moves forward to a chosen tile. Depending on the tile type, if your character has a matching tile type, that character will attain a speed buff while they remain on that tile.

---

### Challenges and Considerations

#### Potential Risks
<!-- 
Identify elements that could fail or require refinement. 
Examples: balancing issues, unclear mechanics, technological constraints. 
-->
Special abilities in my cards can easily become unbalanced. The randomness of event cards could also lead to an unfair element since there are certain cards that can kill your entire team in a single turn (Wrath card).

#### Feasibility
<!-- 
Describe any technological, financial, or development constraints. 
How will you mitigate these risks? 
-->
Financial constraints may be tied to getting people invested in the game. For a game like this you need to make people invested in the characters and the story. I would likely try to incorporate a running story along with the basic play through. Think Cookie Run Kingdom which has story levels and each level has normal combat. The story gets you invested in the characters and that makes you willing to do the level combat.

## Visualizing the Game Concept

### Concept Sketches or Storyboards
- Provide at least **two sketches**  
- Ensure sketches accurately represent the game’s concept and theme  
- Maintain coherence with the game’s style and theme  

<!-- 
Upload sketches here, or describe the key visual elements in detail if unavailable. 
-->

---

## Pitch Preparation

### Pitch Summary
<!-- 
Provide a concise and engaging summary of the game concept and theme. 
Make it persuasive and easy to understand. 
-->
System Failure is a game about fate vs free will where friends become foe in the blink of an eye. Strategize the best way to win against enemy teams as you. Traverse the ever expanding map and rush to your safe zones if you find yourself getting too close to death. Beware of fate's design as denying her commands draw you closer and closer to madness. The game is complex and can allow for fun stories unique to each new game. Designed for the story and strategic focused player theres something for every type of person to enjoy. System Failure will test friendships as betrayal meets you at every step. Test your skills and find out who comes out on top as the one favored by Lady Fate herself in System Failure: Exodus!

### Target Audience Appeal
<!-- 
Explain how the game connects with its intended audience. 
What elements make it particularly appealing to them? 
-->
My target audience would be players interested in roleplay elements, strategy, and story. My game is for people of 12 and up. It would likely be less appealing to casual gamers. Since my game features many characters to choose from, players can choose to roleplay as their team and strategize the best way to make it through it to the portal considering the characters on enemy teams. Sometimes it may be best to take out enemy teams if they are too much of a threat while other times it may be more interesting to find the key and make your way to exit first.

### Market Differentiation
<!-- 
Describe what makes this game unique in the current gaming market. 
Compare it to similar games and highlight key advantages. 
-->
My game is similar to others in the gacha/rpg genre so what gives any game of this style an advantage is the story. I am confident that if I communicate my story properly either in a hidden format that players can find within the basic game (ARG style) or as an explicit story element like in CRK. I also think the feature of fighting other character cards instead of enemies would attract players.

## External Feedback

### Feedback 1
- **Reviewer**:  
  <!-- Enter name and relation to you -->
Name: Jared
Relation: Friend
He gave me a lot of ideas and specifically was the one to tell me about Tanks, Damage, and Healers. He thinks the special ability should be tied to the character type which I agree with. He also had some different ideas about the map. Since neither of us play board games he had a hard time understanding the expanding map idea. I'll look into the map and decided on how the static area should be laid out so that everyone has an equal chance of getting to the healing area. Also refine the location tiles. I'm not sure if they should encompass one location or a tile of several locations. Maybe they don't even have to be squares but other shapes that interlock together.

- **Summary**:  
  <!-- Summarize feedback focusing on concept, mechanics, and style -->
She really liked the game. She figured out a way to play the game would be to kill off/get rid of your team leader so you could make use of a better special ability that one of your other team members have. She had a bit of trouble understanding the character deck doubling as your enemies in the game but that also was probably the language barrier (she only speaks spanish and I speak ok but not perfect). She wasn't fond of the idea of using dice to determine attack damage. I'll look into different ways to handle enemies in board games. To both get other ideas and find better ways to explain it to others.

### Feedback 3
- **Reviewer**:  
  <!-- Enter name and relation to you -->
Name: Gustavo
Relation: Brother in law 
He understood the game, but he thought instead of just Healer, Tank, and Damage, there should also be a Support character that can provide buffs/debuffs. He was unfamiliar with the tile location mechanism but he also doesn't play board games and I was trying to explain it verbally. I'll finalize how many character types I want and what they should be able to do. Maybe I'll change the types so that Healers are stronger against tanks, tanks strong against damage dealers, etc.
