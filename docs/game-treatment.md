<!-- 
Provide a one-sentence summary that captures the core idea of your game. 
This should convey what makes your game unique in a compelling way. 
-->
A race to find the key to salvation before you all lose yourselves to the void; friend becomes foe in the blink of an eye during the end of the world.
---

## Genre and Style

### Genre
<!-- 
Specify the game's genre (e.g., action, adventure, strategy, puzzle). 
Mention any sub-genres if applicable. 
-->
Strategy RPG board game
---

### Style
<!-- 
Describe the tone, visual approach, and gameplay feel. 
Examples: "A dark, gothic horror with hand-drawn 2D animation" or 
"A lighthearted, comedic party game with vibrant colors and exaggerated physics." 
-->
A fast-paced, strategy game with 2D drawing for character cards and unique 3D location tiles.
---

## Target Audience

### Demographics
<!-- 
Identify the target age group, interests, and gamer profile. 
Mention if your game appeals to casual or hardcore players. 
-->
Targetted towards people 12 and up who are interested in roleplay elements, strategy, and story. It would likely not be appealing to casual gamers since it requires keeping track of your own hp
---

### Accessibility
<!-- 
Describe how the game will accommodate different skill levels. 
Will there be difficulty modes, tutorials, assistive options, etc.? 
-->
Skill levels can be accomodated through a tutorial level that walks you through the game before playing against actual players. Modes of difficulty is unlikely to make the game any easier since the point is for it to be a slightly challenging strategy game.
---

### Inclusivity Strategies
<!-- 
Explain how the game promotes inclusivity. 
Consider gender representation, cultural diversity, and accessibility features for disabled players. 
-->
Try to make each tile unique by adding notches or unique symbols. For example, instead of the one-use tiles all being squares with a different symbol, they should all have an imprinted symbol that can be felt by a blind player to identify them. Perhaps an accompanying app to tell you what certain cards are.
The character cards are of varying races, sexualities, and circumstances although it might not be immediately apparent. Some that come to mind are nonbinary characters, lesbian characters, divorced characters, etc.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics
<!-- 
List and describe the core gameplay mechanics players will engage with. 
Explain how they contribute to the game's challenge and fun. 
-->
Character Deck: On your team, you will have three characters that you pull from the shuffled character deck. The enemies you encounter in the game are characters that have fallen to corruption. They are people who could have very well been on your team. As you traverse the expanding area, you may encounter enemies. Pull from the character deck to see who it is.

Team leader: When you begin the game, pull three cards from the character deck. Choose your team captain from the three cards. They will take damage from the opposing team. If your team leader is eliminated you can choose who to make the new team leader.

Character Special Ability: Every character has a special ability. This is something unique to them that can be used to put your team at an advantage over others. Has limited uses. Special abilities will specify if you can use them during traversal, combat, or both.

Combat: Place the team leader at the front with the two other characters behind them. During your turn you can use one special ability before performing an action (attack or use item). You may also choose to retreat from a battle.

Character type: TANK, SUPPORT, DAMAGE. TANK has max DEF at 2. SUPPORT has max SPD at 3. DAMAGE has max ATK at 3. 

Character Stats: HP always starts at 20. ATK ranges from 1-3. DEF ranges from 0-2. SPD ranges from 1-3. Based on SPD, add up SPD of all characters on your team and compare against the enemy's total SPD, whoever has the most goes first. Based on ATK, roll matching number of dice and attack the team leader of the opposing team. Based on DEF, remove the highest dice rolls with the remaining dice being your damage. 

Static locations: Starting zone cannot be reentered once it is left. This is where you start the game. The ending location is the portal out blocked by a locked gate which must be opened using a key.

Dynamic location tiles: Location tiles are color coded. If your team has a character with a matching color, their SPD increases by 1. Consider it home turf advantage. The characters are all from different dimensions, the color of the location tiles tells you what dimension it is. If you move onto a place where a tile has not been placed, pull a new tile and put it where you are.

Corruption: A meter that starts at 0 for all characters. Ranges from 0-3. Every time your corruption increases, their HP goes up by 5. Once corruption reaches 3, the character turns on you and you must fight them. 

Event cards: From the moment you leave the starting area, pull an event card every other turn. Cards may be as simple as finding an item (potion, weapon, shield, key, movement double, corruption reduction) or a command with a consequence if it isn't performed. Consequence event cards tell you to do something and if you don't do it, raise corruption level of one of your characters by 1. You choose which one takes on the corruption. Certain consequence event cards are significantly worse and will prompt you to raise a character's corruption by 2 (capped at 3) if ignored. There is also a game over card labeled WRATH that forcibly corrupts all of your characters and eliminates you from the game which cannot be ignored. 

Abandonment: If a character is getting too close to their corruption threshold, you can choose to abandon them. Place their character card on the top of the character card deck. Whoever encounters an enemy next will be facing your old teammate.

## Story and Setting

### Setting
<!-- 
Describe the game world, its rules, and any unique environmental elements. 
Provide enough detail to establish immersion. 
-->
The setting is a world where people of many lands (and even other dimensions) have come together to live as one striving for greater things. Generally nature and technology have united in a unique way to create a picture of cool colors and thriving wildlife. There are many species and civilizations each with rich and unique history seperate from eachother. The multiverse that this dimension lives in is one bound by the hands of fate. Defying your fate creates instability in a dimension and once too much instability has accumulated, a dimension will collapse into the abyss between worlds. It is for this reason that fate has bound people to their destinies. If people cannot defy a set path, then instability cannot accumulate and the people will live and die as they should. However this world, as far as it has come felt that the laws that fate so kindle bestowed onto them were shackles and chose to forcibly liberate themselves from their paths. Instability ran rampant and human hubris grew exponentially. Fate cared not for the arrogant mortals and allowed them to die by their own hands. But fate is kind, and so she allowed for one final back door to help any mortals that were strong or smart enough to make it out.

### Plot
<!-- 
Outline the central narrative arc. 
What is the player’s role in the story, and what major events drive the gameplay forward? 
-->
"Our world is bound by fate. Every action you have ever done or will one day do has already been determined. And yet, your world had the gall to liberate itself from universal laws. For your people's audacity, the world has been doomed to fall, but fear not! The last survivors will be allowed to escape with their lives. Be you good or bad, all are free to walk out on their own two feet. A game of survival where friends and foes my turn on one another, who will be the one to make it out alive with their sanity intact?"

The world is collapsing and any who come too close to the instability lose their minds to the corruption. A single portal remains open and it is your job to find you way to the portal with a method of opening the gate that seperates you from freedom. Dungeons have appeared in the farthest corners of the world that are home to weapons and tools. Traverse this ever growing dungeon filled with the shadows of your friends and family to find what you need. Outside of the dungeon you have some rooms that will provide you with other services but beware of the other teams that are trying for the same goal as you. If they see you as a threat, they may just choose to kill you or die trying.

### Characters
<!-- 
List key characters, their roles, and how they impact the story. 
Describe their motivations, personality traits, and influence on the player’s journey. 
-->
The characters in your team are people who were in the doomed world at the time of its collapse. This does not necessarily mean that this is their home world however. The game features different characters with unique stories and personalities. Your team will consist of three characters or less. Some examples of characters are,
- The Innovator
- The Oracle
- The King
- The Outlander
- The Derelict
- etc.

## Unique Selling Points (USP)
<!-- 
Identify what makes your game stand out from others in its genre. 
Highlight key features that differentiate it in the market. 
-->
The unique selling point of the game is the corruption system. Being able to keep characters and abandon them at a tactically opportune time makes my game unique from the others.

---

## Inspiration

### Sources
<!-- 
List books, movies, historical events, or games that influenced this project. 
-->
Games like Betrayal at House on the Hill and standard Gacha games like Genshin, Honkai, and Cookie Run Kingdom. I also used my own story which features the multiverse theory (probably from my Undertale phase). 
---

### Why It Matters
<!-- 
Explain how these inspirations shape the game’s mechanics, visuals, or themes. 
-->
The multiverse theory influences the concept of location tiles being color coded and giving certain characters higher speed. That way you know that certain characters are from post-apocalyptic worlds, cyberpunk cities, science motivated societies, etc.
Betrayal at House on the Hill influenced my idea on making the expanding map and having different characters with unique stats.
Giving characters special abilities and RNG to see who you get comes from Gacha games.
---

## Player Experience Goals
