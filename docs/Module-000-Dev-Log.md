### Module: 1

### Date: [01/25/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Understand what makes a game a game.
- [ ] Goal 2: How to balance the various qualities of a game and gameplay.
- [ ] Goal 3: How do card games work,,,,,,,,,,

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I've started thinking about how I can make a TCG that will interest me. Genshin TCG go brrr gotta catch em all yknow
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  Not really any issues just the realization that I had to make a TCG because I know even less about board games.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I tried to think of the few TCGs I was familiar with. Genshin, Pokemon, and Inscryption.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  N/A

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I thought I could use the concept of Inscryption to make the TCG interest me and incorporate the characters I've invested myself into since Middle School. I could communicate story through the card visuals and description like Genshin communicates lore through artifact or weapon descriptions. I could also incorporate a gatcha element into my game since I tend to enjoy those. I was thinking I could make it so that playing certain cards in sequence could lead to unique interactions that give you hints about the person you're playing against.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Research more into TCGs

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: How to balance the various qualities of a game and gameplay.
- [ ] Goal 2: Think of simplifying/streamlining my story concept
- [ ] Goal 3: How do card games work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I've begun practicing my art and I've been able to make some nice full body sketches, so hopefully I'll be able to draw my own card designs.
  - I played that atari game Crypts of Chaos and man is it confusing. I'll be honest I do not know old games, so I was so lost in the beginning. I'll be writing up my case study after this now that I was able to play the game.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - If I want my concept to be around my story I will likely need to either group parts of the story into chapters or create a concrete end. Since my story is just for my own enjoyment it's a convoluted mess which would likely make for a very tiring or overwhelming game experience.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I'm planning on organizing the important parts of my story. I saw some websites that help you make timelines for events, so I'll probably use those to make it easier for myself.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- N/A (still not really sure what that means,,,,,)

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  In terms of concepts I was thinking for my story I could have a split betweeen day and night. Day would be free roam and allow you to interact with characters and learn new things. You could also find new cards hidden around the area. When the day ends, the main character will go to sleep and find themselves in a card game against someone who seems to know them. I'm thinking what could make this interesting is if you are allowed to freely ask this person questions but that would be,,,, very difficult. Ideally the goal of this game is for the player to find the mc's identity and the identity of the person in your dreams. There should be a disconnect between the player and the main character. The mc knows who they are but the player does not. Their goals should not align. At least, if the person I'm thinking of making the mc does end up being them. It might be more interesting to make it someone else. Or make it someone new to take the place of the player who truly knows nothing.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Streamline story and start sketching card designs and ideas.

### Date: [02/14/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: learn more about card games
- [ ] Goal 2: start to commit game concepts to memory for whenever we get the exam
- [ ] Goal 3: still need to do those designs

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I researched card game designs and mechanics (just a little bit honestly). 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Im starting to realize how difficult it will be to make a fleshed out trading card game.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - While I was researching I came across a video describing poker, go fish, etc and it occured to me as a fail safe I could try to make a game based on these. Somehow I had completely forgotten those type of games existed. OMG WAIT WHAT IF I MAKE A CHESS TYPE GAME BUT THE PIECES ALL HAVE COOL MECHANICS??? LESS TO THINK ABOUT AND MORE STRUCTURED RULES???? a thought. to consider :)

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Make sure cards are legible. Make the important parts of your cards where your player will quickly see them. ALso consider the way the player will these cards. For example, consider playing a game with physical cards in hand. Normally you have them splayed out so you can see one of the top corners of your card. Important info should be visible to the player here. Lead the player's eyes to the important information.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Chess. But the pieces are unique characters????? A thought. I'll still have to learn how board games work, but it might just be less daunting than a trading card game. Plus the project is supposed to be a player v player type thing, so my plan on making the player play against some other entity won't work.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- RESEARCH BOARD GAMES. AND CHESS. PROBABLY CHECKERS BECAUSE CHESS IS SCARY.
