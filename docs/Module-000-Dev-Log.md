#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I've started thinking about how I can make a TCG that will interest me. Genshin TCG go brrr gotta catch em all yknow
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  Not really any issues just the realization that I had to make a TCG because I know even less about board games.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I tried to think of the few TCGs I was familiar with. Genshin, Pokemon, and Inscryption.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  N/A

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I thought I could use the concept of Inscryption to make the TCG interest me and incorporate the characters I've invested myself into since Middle School. I could communicate story through the card visuals and description like Genshin communicates lore through artifact or weapon descriptions. I could also incorporate a gatcha element into my game since I tend to enjoy those. I was thinking I could make it so that playing certain cards in sequence could lead to unique interactions that give you hints about the person you're playing against.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Research more into TCGs
