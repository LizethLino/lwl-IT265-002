### Module: 1

### Date: [01/25/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Understand what makes a game a game.
- [ ] Goal 2: How to balance the various qualities of a game and gameplay.
- [ ] Goal 3: How do card games work,,,,,,,,,,

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I've started thinking about how I can make a TCG that will interest me. Genshin TCG go brrr gotta catch em all yknow
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  Not really any issues just the realization that I had to make a TCG because I know even less about board games.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I tried to think of the few TCGs I was familiar with. Genshin, Pokemon, and Inscryption.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  N/A

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  I thought I could use the concept of Inscryption to make the TCG interest me and incorporate the characters I've invested myself into since Middle School. I could communicate story through the card visuals and description like Genshin communicates lore through artifact or weapon descriptions. I could also incorporate a gatcha element into my game since I tend to enjoy those. I was thinking I could make it so that playing certain cards in sequence could lead to unique interactions that give you hints about the person you're playing against.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
-  Research more into TCGs

### Module: 2

### Date: [02/04/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: How to balance the various qualities of a game and gameplay.
- [ ] Goal 2: Think of simplifying/streamlining my story concept
- [ ] Goal 3: How do card games work,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I've begun practicing my art and I've been able to make some nice full body sketches, so hopefully I'll be able to draw my own card designs.
  - I played that atari game Crypts of Chaos and man is it confusing. I'll be honest I do not know old games, so I was so lost in the beginning. I'll be writing up my case study after this now that I was able to play the game.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - If I want my concept to be around my story I will likely need to either group parts of the story into chapters or create a concrete end. Since my story is just for my own enjoyment it's a convoluted mess which would likely make for a very tiring or overwhelming game experience.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  I'm planning on organizing the important parts of my story. I saw some websites that help you make timelines for events, so I'll probably use those to make it easier for myself.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- N/A (still not really sure what that means,,,,,)

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
-  In terms of concepts I was thinking for my story I could have a split betweeen day and night. Day would be free roam and allow you to interact with characters and learn new things. You could also find new cards hidden around the area. When the day ends, the main character will go to sleep and find themselves in a card game against someone who seems to know them. I'm thinking what could make this interesting is if you are allowed to freely ask this person questions but that would be,,,, very difficult. Ideally the goal of this game is for the player to find the mc's identity and the identity of the person in your dreams. There should be a disconnect between the player and the main character. The mc knows who they are but the player does not. Their goals should not align. At least, if the person I'm thinking of making the mc does end up being them. It might be more interesting to make it someone else. Or make it someone new to take the place of the player who truly knows nothing.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Streamline story and start sketching card designs and ideas.

### Date: [02/06/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: learn more about card games
- [ ] Goal 2: start to commit game concepts to memory for whenever we get the exam
- [ ] Goal 3: still need to do those designs

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I researched card game designs and mechanics (just a little bit honestly). 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Im starting to realize how difficult it will be to make a fleshed out trading card game.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - While I was researching I came across a video describing poker, go fish, etc and it occured to me as a fail safe I could try to make a game based on these. Somehow I had completely forgotten those type of games existed. OMG WAIT WHAT IF I MAKE A CHESS TYPE GAME BUT THE PIECES ALL HAVE COOL MECHANICS??? LESS TO THINK ABOUT AND MORE STRUCTURED RULES???? a thought. to consider :)

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Make sure cards are legible. Make the important parts of your cards where your player will quickly see them. ALso consider the way the player will these cards. For example, consider playing a game with physical cards in hand. Normally you have them splayed out so you can see one of the top corners of your card. Important info should be visible to the player here. Lead the player's eyes to the important information.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Chess. But the pieces are unique characters????? A thought. I'll still have to learn how board games work, but it might just be less daunting than a trading card game. Plus the project is supposed to be a player v player type thing, so my plan on making the player play against some other entity won't work.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- RESEARCH BOARD GAMES. AND CHESS. PROBABLY CHECKERS BECAUSE CHESS IS SCARY.

### Module: 3

### Date: [02/11/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Learning Look and feel
- [ ] Goal 2: Start reading the textbook and take notes
- [ ] Goal 3: Arrange for characters to use for my project

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Wrote up notes for look and feel. The textbook is pretty good with explanations although I feel like it loses itself at times with its examples over definitions. Figured out some characters to use for my story. Currently have 19 names with most of them having good backstories already. Ideally I want to have a few more, but we’ll see how feasible that is.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Some of the characters will need to be modified to make them fit into the game I’m thinking of.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - My plan is to rewrite/reinterpret their lore based on the way the game will go. To do that I’ll need the layout of the game to be more finalized which will take a bit.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I’ve always been more of a visual person so look & feel shouldn’t be difficult to consider. For what my game might entail I want to see if I can communicate the story in a visual way that will keep players interested.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- When it comes to characters I’m good at making their stories fun and interesting but I am significantly worse at specific things like design or clothing. That’ll be something I’ll have to focus on for a while to make sure I’m satisfied.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Start thinking about how the game will work. Think about designs for the characters and how they should be drawn onto cards or the like.

### Date: [02/13/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Learning color theory
- [ ] Goal 2: Figure out game ideas
- [ ] Goal 3: Start reading the textbook and take notes

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Read through color theory slides. Started thinking up a concept for the board game I’m going for. Color schemes for characters is being considered.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Not sure how much I should include in the game. I want to incorporate some aspects of character story into this game but that might be too difficult to do in a board game.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Consider removing some ideas in favor of something that will still have many characters without being overly complicated. Make PVP a main focus and not just limited to certain characters.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Considering using split complementary or triadic colors for my character designs.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I already have core colors for 9 characters and the others will ideally not overlap. Or I can have the colors overlap based on the type of card it is… To be explained in the next entry. Gotta dig out my old markers to test out color schemes. I never color in my drawings so this will likely be an experience.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Detail the game idea so far in the next entry.

### Module: 4

### Date: [02/18/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Learning Game Mechanics
- [ ] Goal 2: Game idea time
- [ ] Goal 3: Start reading the textbook and take notes

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Idea of a board game has been made but not finalized. Definitely ambitious but ideally something like “Betrayal at house on the hill” would be cool.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Too many ideas that can’t be realistically implemented together.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Keep the ideas I like and focus on thinking of alternative implementations for my other ideas or removing them altogether.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- n/a

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- My notes from class on my idea. They are messy but they are mine.

Have character cards and separate teams
The first character card you pull before the game starts determines your team leader. The team leader decides your team’s win objectives. 
There are several evil characters.
Throughout the game you will have at least a team of three characters (either once in the beginning with 2 more throughout the course of the game or 3 character card pulls in the beginning of the game)
If you pull an evil character card, they automatically become the team leader and your win objectives change to the objectives of the evil character
Characters have relationships with other characters. Depending on your team leader, you will gain benefits from acting against or in support of certain characters.
HOWEVER, you do not reveal to other team’s who your character is
Consider, you have the ability to ask questions to determine whos on their team
The characters in your hand determine the things you can do, each having separate skills
High tier characters have specific weapon cards that if used by them will double their attack power. (character with a signature weapon)
Whoever achieves the win objectives first wins
If you identify an evil team you can target them to take out possible enemies

character card types
Villains (usually, kill off other teams)
Traitors (can overthrow their team leader,,, switch teams???)
Heroes (keep their team members safe)

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Decide on the goal and setting of the game.

### Date: [02/20/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Discuss ideas for my game with other people
- [ ] Goal 2: Start sketching some ideas for cards
- [ ] Goal 3: Start reading the textbook and take notes

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Bounced ideas off of a friend. Minimized some of the mechanics for the sake of simplicity.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Some mechanics that I think would be really cool ultimately might just be too much trouble to implement without making the game confusing.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Removing some of the mechanics in favor of others.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- New notes on the idea 

SETTING: Time has stopped and the world has begun to close in on itself, crumbling into the void. A single portal remains open on the other side of the map that is your salvation. However this portal only has enough space for one team. Your goal is to survive and reach the portal first to make it out with your life. Some teams may sabotage others and lay traps or kill if they feel the need to. This is a game of betrayal.

Maybe assign one of the seven deadly sins to each card and make it their type (like pokemon types). Balance type weaknesses.

Map should force teams to interact with each other so pathways should converge at points to encourage pvp. Maybe the map has hidden passageways that can be unlocked by event cards.

Maybe the portal should be blocked off by a locked gate? That would make teams want to fight for the key. 

If you kill a team you are able to get one of their items. All teams can PVP but maybe villain teams can lay traps or close off pathways forcing players to take other paths. 

Create ambiance in the game by showing the map crumbling on the sides. Maybe after a certain amount of time the map starts falling apart? Who knows.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Create a solid idea for the game then focus entirely on card and map design.

### Module: 5

### Date: [02/25/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Wrote notes on Game Mechanics and Depth Vs Complexity
- [ ] Goal 2: Figure out more about my game
- [ ] Goal 3: Secret third thing

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Finished my notes on Game Mechanics and Depth Vs Complexity. Got an idea for the enemy type of my game.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Having trouble deiciding how complex I should make my game. Also don't want to just make my game too similar to existing ones.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - I'm thinking of watching playthroughs of popular games to get ideas of mechanics. I have never played a legend of zelda game nor watched a hollow knight playthrough, so I'm thinking of doing that first.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I want to add a significant amount of depth. I always care more about story rather than gameplay so I trying to make it so my game mechanics allow for a plot of some sort to be hidden beneath the surface. Oh that somehow reminded me of those old markiplier playthroughs of games where you were infected all along... I should look those up too.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I was talking through my story to my friend and I realized that it lended itself well to a main enemy type in the game. Essentially I'm thinking the setting is a bit like a zombie apocalypse. Corruption of the world can contaminate the people themselves and your teams are the only people left uninfected. Any character cards you didn't pick are the enemies you find along the way with their damage defense and hp doubles maybe? I'm wondering if there should be character card tiers where some are better than others but I don't want to make that too broken. Maybe higher tier characters can search for certain items that unlock their unique abilities? So they can waste time searching for an item to give them the ability to destroy parts of the map or just speed ahead as a normal player. Who knows. I certainly don't.
- Bonds definitely play a part here. Maybe if you have good relationships with people before they were corrupted you might do less damage against them. Ohhh or maybe the enemy might choose to ignore you since they were close to you. A thought to consider.
- Maybe you get role cards that define how you act? Most corrupted are feral (not for brains or human flesh tho) and just act erractically but that isn't always the case. Maybe you can be infected and your role is to infect others. (I SWEAR I DONT WANT THIS TO BE LIKE AMONG US BUT IT KEEPS SOUNDING LIKE AMONG US IM GONNA LOSE MY MIND MY MARBLES ARE EVERYWHERE WHY IS EVERYTHING AMONGST US)

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- More game stuff

### Date: [02/27/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Discuss ideas for my game with friend
- [ ] Goal 2: Read over the Design treatment doc to start outlining my idea
- [ ] Goal 3: Find the example he showed in class

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Started looking over the design treatment and thought up more ideas based on Betrayal at House on the Hill. Thought more about my game. This is less technical thought and just ideas (when is it ever technical really)
 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - n/a (same thing as always how do I balance things)

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - n/a

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- n/a

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I don't think I want the game to be a among us type thing with an imposter no matter how tempting the idea is.
- Expanding on the idea of corruption. Maybe theres a certain level of corruption a character has that increases overtime and can be affected by other events. I like the number 10 but that might be too much. Maybe 6? Level 4 is the threshold where you go from mostly sane to completely feral. If one of your team members becomes corrupted, their level starts at 1 and can be increased over time (maybe every few turns or specific encounters?). The benefit of keeping a character on your team as they are corrupted is that their attack and durability go up making them better when taking on harder challanges (still gotta figure out what those challanges are).
- I'm wondering how I should go about a corrupted character. Maybe if a noncorrupted character dies they get shuffled into the character card deck and can be randomly found later corrupt as an enemy. A corrupted character who "dies" is immediately feral and attacks your team. To avoid this you can abandon a corrupted teammate at any point and shuffle them into the character deck to encounter them as an enemy later. I'm thinking to make it more difficult maybe you can attach weapons or enhancements to characters and if they die or get abandoned they leave with their items. I'm wondering how I can make it so that they can't just take the weapons or enhancements from them without consequence. Maybe they can only be swapped? Maybe they cost something to be removed? decisions decisions. I like this idea though.
- OTHER IDEA. Maybe I can create zones on the map and each zone has a seperate character deck. Either you can choose where to abandon your teammate and shuffle their card into any zone deck or you shuffle them into whatever zone deck your in, so in theory you can specifically go to a zone where other people are in, let your teammate leave with their weapons and enhancements making them a harder enemy for other people to fight and essentially making certain parts of the map riskier than others. I actually really like this zone idea. Maybe certain zones have different loot? Definitely something to consider. Still wondering how static or dynamic the map should be. AHHHHH

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- start design treatment so I don't die during midterm week (I HAVE THREE EXAMS IN TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS WHY ME)
- I'll be using the design treatment to guide my thinking otherwise my brain would be too all over the place (as you can see)

### Module: 6

### Date: [03/04/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Think of new concepts to fill in the gaps
- [ ] Goal 2: Study the textbook
- [ ] Goal 3: Look up accessibility in board games

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Think of some of the actual concepts like points, cost for movement, etc. Also think about how to make my game accessible.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - I realized my game would probably not be very acessible to the visually impaired since the map is something that is put together and wouldn't be able to be touched without messing up the map.
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - Consider changing the map or location tiles to make them interlock and be able to be touched more easily

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- When I was looking up accesibility in games I saw how some board games had plastic covers to add braille over the board which is actually really cool.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
World is falling apart, concepts that can work with this
* locations are unstable and can faze in and out of existence (timer mechanism kinda like the space time distortion ig)
* Characters become corrupted and begin to lose control of their own actions (maybe at level 3 corruption theres a chance they can attack teammates?)
* Time aspects? Idk if that will fit
* Maybe add in corrupted beasts? Difficulty is corrupted people < corrupted teammates < corrupted beasts?

Items
* Standard weapons and high tier weapons
* Healing items
* Enhancement items (maybe artifacts or food that buffs?)
* Armor?

Consumables
* Energy????
* Idk if money is gonna be important here
* Maybe trading items for other better (or worse) items?

Enemies
* Should they be roaming or static in location?
* Either layout event spaces on the board that prompts events or
* Do enemies provoke the attack or retaliate
* Enemies have preferred types of people to attack? Maybe based on bonds? Or character typing
* Every time a character attacks they 

Dungeons?
* Temporary places appear that get a random item either you know what youll get from the beginning or you don’t who knows

Characters
* Should they have specialties?
* Something to do with sins? I feel like it would be cooler to make it an item/event card
* All cards can attack but should all be able to heal
* Cards should have specialties like melee, brawler, ranged, support, magic, etc

Goal is to find your way through the gate to get to the portal first team there wins

Multiple ways to win?
* Attack the gate
* Find the key

7 Deadly Sin Event cards
* Wrath: Kill off one of your teammates. You cannot remove items from their inventory. Their life was forfeit and nothing matters beyond satiating your own bloodlust.
* Sloth: Don’t move for 5 turns. ??? smthn like that 

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Finalize idea and finish design treatment

### Date: [03/06/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Finish design treatment
- [ ] Goal 2: Study for midterm
- [ ] Goal 3: ---

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I finished the design treatment :D
 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - I didnt really have any issues since most of it was just writing out things I already had in my head. Although theme has always been something I didn't understand.

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - n/a

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Accesibility in gaming. Game themes because those are confusing and I hate them. 

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I'm wondering how I should make my location tiles. It would be cool to go a bit crazy and make them 3D but it would proabably be better to just make them a normal card. I'm probably going to use a combination of cardboard and cardstock (and index cards) to make my physical prototype. Most of the effort will go into character and ability creation since they have to be unique.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- make physical prototype over the break


### Date: [03/25/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Be ready to present
- [ ] Goal 2: Make some final pieces of the physical prototype if we have time
- [ ] Goal 3: Think of more special abilities

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Over the break I finished 20 character designs and made a few location tiles and event cards to show how the game works. I should make more to actually test the game. Also stole some dice from a friend (I'll probably give them back).
 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Some special abilities are a bit overpowered depending on when you used them.

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - we specificed when you would be able to use them. Field, combat, and field/combat special abiilities.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- We considered making seperate dimensions that the tiles can come from. This allows the characters to have diverse designs based on where they are from.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I'll keep the location tiles to flat surfaces for the sake of the physical prototype. Digitally I'd like for each to have some sort of design.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Make more location tiles and event cards for testing.

### Date: [03/27/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Figure out new designs for the maiden/matron (I just don't like it)
- [ ] Goal 2: Start thinking about how to do things digitally
- [ ] Goal 3: Special abilities might prove to be a problem

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Made more location tiles. Studying for another class so haven't been able to do as much.
 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - Realized there was an issue with the way I wanted DEF to work in the game. 

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - We changed it to a dice roll and will update the cards so their DEF goes from 1-3.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- n/a

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- not much. Wondering how I'll learn C# for the digital prototype.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Look into object oriented programming since I haven't done it for awhile.

### Module: 7 & 8 (I need to study for a quiz)

### Date: [03/08/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Watch people present
- [ ] Goal 2: consider how to code the game
- [ ] Goal 3: (For reference I have a terrible sense of time so events will be out of order)

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - I wasn't here on the first of April which just so happened to be the week lectures began again so woe is me. I haven't done much but I did start playing Pokemon Pocket which has given me some ideas for how card games work.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - n/a
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - n/a

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- Consider the phases of combat and the idea of an End Turn button

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- I've been playing around with the idea of being able to lay traps or something like that. The possibility of just cycling around for the event cards you need seems like a likely problem to encounter.

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Do more testing.

### Date: [03/10/2025]

#### Goals for this Module
- [ ] Goal 1: Coding game considerations
- [ ] Goal 2: 2D and Hex grids
- [ ] Goal 3: ---

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - Learning about 2D grids made me think that coding the expanding map might be troublesome. I'll have to look into expanding arrays which in the moment the only thing I could think of was malloc, calloc, and realloc which might be troublesome.
 
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  - n/a

- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  - n/a

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- n/a

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.
- Honestly haven't done much becuase of other exams I've had. The 2D grids did catch my attention. Once I study for my quiz I'll look up game programming videos and the like. 

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
- Look into Unity and C#
